Offered to help a friend with a bike shop build a new site.

Current site is WoodsideBikeShop.com.  How can I go wrong?
New site is resting at woodside-bike-shop.herokuapp.com waiting for a few photos and blogs

This is a mobile friendly site using owner provided photos.
It's a pretty simple site. I added a wordpress site and plan to add a query feature when there is some blog volume.  I set up the site so online purchases can be added later.

I wanted to learn something from doing this site since it is so simple.  I decided to up my design skills so added grid, flexbox, and animation on scroll. I'm not a designer. Don't judge.

I played with several npm styling packages and used some components from BlueprintJS. Hoping for a real complete component package in 2018.  No one is quite there yet.

Stack:
React, Redux, Node, Mongo (set up but not used yet).

Libraries/Tools:
Create React App,
Express,
Passport,
Wordpress,
react-router-dom,
react-dom,
react-redux,
redux-thunk,
axios,
react-animate-on-scroll,
@blueprintjs/core,
react-fa
react-media
